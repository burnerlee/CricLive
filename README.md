# CricLive
Cricket anytime anywhere

CricLive VR - is a platform designed for such cricket fans to help them watch live cricket anywhere for free even with a very slow internet connection. CricLive is based on a really unique mechanism to generate live streaming of the cricket match. It scrapes text commentary from any of the many available websites on the web,feeds it to an indigenously trained ML model feeds it to an ML model, which estimates what exactly happened that delivery and provides the output to the user end platform developed on Unity, which replicates the incident actually taking place on the real field virtually using models, animations and algorithms. Whatâ€™s more? CricLive supports VR technology and allows you to get into action and be one of the player/umpiresumpire on the field or view the match as a spectator sitting in a real stadium.

This Project was developed on Unity Game Engine using Unity Collaborate:
