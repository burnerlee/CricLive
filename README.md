Imagine there is an Ind vs Aus match going on and you are not at your home, but you desperately want to watch it. You quickly open up Hotstar to watch its live streaming, but, alas! The 15 minutes of trial time is over. You take your credit card, pay for the subscription, and continue watching it again. But your luck is hard! You don’t have a good internet connection. What do you do? You visit live cricket score websites and read through the commentary of each ball imagining what would be happening on the field.

Fret not. CricLive VR comes to your rescue. A platform for cricket lovers to watch live cricket anywhere, anytime, with a good or poor internet connection completely free. CricLive is based on a really unique mechanism to generate live streaming of the cricket match. It scrapes text commentary from the web, feeds it to an indigenously trained ML model, which estimates what exactly happened that delivery and provides the output to the user end platform developed on Unity, which replicates the incident actually taking place on the real field virtually using models, animations and algorithms. What’s more? CricLive supports VR technology and allows you to get into action and be one of the players/umpires on the field or view the match as a spectator sitting in a real stadium.
